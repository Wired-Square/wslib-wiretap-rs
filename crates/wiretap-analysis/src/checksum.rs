//! Which bytes are worth solving as a checksum.
//!
//! [`wiretap_checksum`] answers *what algorithm is this byte*. It is now cheap
//! enough to ask blindly — an exhaustive CRC-16 sweep is milliseconds — but
//! asking blindly still means asking the wrong question of most of a bus. On a
//! Sungrow BMS link, 62 of 62 frame ids get a full sweep to conclude nothing.
//!
//! This module asks the prior question, from one pass over consecutive payloads.
//!
//! # The decisive test is a rejection, not a score
//!
//! A checksum is a *function of the other bytes*. So if two payloads agree on
//! every byte except this column, and this column differs, no function can
//! produce both — the column cannot be a checksum over any subset of the rest.
//! That is not a heuristic and it needs no threshold; it is arithmetic, and it
//! removes counters, sequence numbers and free-running timers outright.
//!
//! # What is left is separated by two conditional rates
//!
//! For the survivors, the useful signal is how reliably the column moves *with*
//! the payload:
//!
//! - a real checksum changes almost every time the payload does — it collides
//!   only about one time in `2^bits`;
//! - a sensor byte often sits still while other bytes move, because it measures
//!   one quantity and they measure others.
//!
//! Entropy alone cannot make this distinction, which is the trap worth naming.
//! On the same link, the cell-voltage frames carry four 16-bit readings that
//! jitter constantly — 120 distinct payloads in 121 frames, entropy near the
//! maximum, and not a checksum among them.
