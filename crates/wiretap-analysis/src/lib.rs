//! Payload analysis for WireTAP frames.
//!
//! - [`checksum`] — the identification pass: which bytes are worth handing to
//!   [`wiretap_checksum`]'s solvers, and why the rest were not.
//! - [`scan`] — the orchestration over a whole capture: group by frame id,
//!   sample, identify, sweep, solve, rank.
//! - [`roles`] — what each byte does, addressed from the front: static,
//!   counter, sensor, value, the 16- and 32-bit counters, sensors and text that
//!   span columns, and the mux selectors that split a frame into cases.
//! - [`structure`] — a serial link's id and source-address bytes.
//! - [`hypothesis`] — candidate bit fields over one frame's payload, ranked
//!   against its byte roles. Reached by path: its `CandidateReason` is not
//!   [`structure`]'s.
//! - [`order`] — message order per bus: interval groups, cycle start ids and
//!   sequences, mux and burst timing, and the ids seen on more than one bus.
//! - [`mirror`] — mirror groups: ids carrying the same changing payload together.
//! - [`notes`] — what a byte profile says, as note codes for the caller to word.
//! - [`summary`] — the counts a Payload Changes or Frame Order report sums up.
//! - [`dashboard`] — a Dashboard panel's counters: the histogram and the bit
//!   toggles. Reached by path.
//! - [`draft`] — profiles and message order merged per protocol and frame, and
//!   the typed [`wiretap_catalog`] ops that write them; the `byte_*` signals
//!   offered for a frame without a catalogue. Reached by path.
//! - [`query`] — the analytical query kernels over rows already read, answering in
//!   [`wiretap_gateway`]'s result types. Reached by path.
//!
//! Per-byte-column statistics live in [`wiretap_checksum::columns`], beside the
//! addressing they are indexed by. A caller that needs them
//! depends on that crate directly, as this one does; they are not re-exported.
//!
//! `wiretap-checksum` answers *what algorithm is this byte*; this crate answers
//! the prior question — *is this byte a checksum at all* — and drives the scan
//! that puts the two together.
//!
//! The two crates stay separate, and the byte-role classifier sits here beside
//! the identification pass, reading the same [`ColumnStats`] from the front
//! rather than bringing a statistics set of its own. The reasoning is in the
//! WireTAP-lib vault, `Plans/lib-extraction-a-api.md`.
//!
//! [`ColumnStats`]: wiretap_checksum::columns::ColumnStats
