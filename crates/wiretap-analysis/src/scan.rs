//! Scanning a whole capture for checksums, frame id by frame id.
//!
//! This is the orchestration: group by frame id, sample twice, identify, sweep,
//! solve, rank. It sits here rather than in the application because everything
//! it does is a pure function of payloads, and because a second consumer — a
//! catalogue validator asking "does this declared checksum hold?" — cannot reach
//! into an app binary.
//!
//! # Two sample sets, because the halves want opposite things
//!
//! The sweep measures a *rate*, so it needs the population with its repeats:
//! "this column never moved in 400 frames" is exactly the claim the
//! constant-column rejection rests on, and deduplicating first leaves it one
//! sample to judge on — which is how an all-zero frame gets reported as a
//! flawless XOR. The solvers are killed only by disagreements, so repeats are
//! dead weight and what they want is *distinct* payloads.
